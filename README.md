#### Hello World ðŸ‘‹ It's Parth!
I'm a Computer Science engineer with a knack of mathematics and algorithms, deeply passionate about designing complex systems, exploring cutting-edge tech architectures, and diving into all things programming. Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the hustle of startupsâ€”brainstorming ideas, building fast, and solving real problems. All about creating meaningful, scalable products rather than just checking off projects. Outside of work, I love playing sports, following Formula 1, cheering on ICT and PS nights!

#### I look forward to 
  :cricket_game: Matchdays<br>
  :money_with_wings: Markets, if aligned<br>
  :car: Formula 1 races<br>
  :calendar: Mondays as much as Fridays <br>
